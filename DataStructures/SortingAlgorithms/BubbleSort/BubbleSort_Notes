Bubble Sort :

	We will iterate through all the values in array
		Compare the adjescent values 
		Swap accordingly
		By the end of first iteration last oject will be sorted 
	Now take remaining array except the last object and follow the above process
	
	Time complexity O(n^2)
	This is in-place algorithm  no additional memory required
