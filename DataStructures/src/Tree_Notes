Tree Data Structure :

  Tree is a hierarchical DataStructure.
  
 
 Binary Tree :
  It is a Data Structure where every node will have at most 2 children.
  
 Binary Search Tree :
  It is a Binary tree will Left child will have lesser value and right child will have more value.
  
  We can search the element in BST in O(logn)
   
      we are reducing the search criteria
      			 n/2 -- n/4 -- n/8
      			 n/2^k = 1
      			 n= 2^k
      			 k = log(n)
