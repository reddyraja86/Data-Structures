Stack 

	LIFO Last in First out implementation  

	Avaialble methods :
 		push()  Insert element at top
 		pop()	Removes element at the top
 		peek()  Returns the element at the top 
 		isEmpty() Returns true if stack is empty, else false.

  	Time complexity will O(1) for all the above methods
  	
 Different ways of implementing it
 
 	Arrays     
 	LinkedList


 Array : As the Array is of limited size when it fills up we need to copy them again to a new Array this is not efficient.
 
 LinkedList : Grows Dynamically 
 
 				We can use single Linked List
 				
 					Add the head element 
 						When ever a new node added add it to the head.next element
 						When we pop remove the element after head
 						When we  peek get the element after head
