Queue :

  Queue is First in First out implementation
  
  Operations in Queue :
  
  	push(),pop(),peek(),isEmpty() this will take O(1) constant time to solve
  	
  	
  we can implement Queue by using Arrays or Linked List
  
  By using Linked List :
  
    We have to maintain head and tail pointers 
    In Push method we will add the object to the tail
       Pop  method we will remove from the head
